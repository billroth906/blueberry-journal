### Trying Out K6
An aspect that I have been impressed by in recent months is the beauty of what the console can do when it is allowed to sing. K6 was a joy to implement, and its results are a joy to read. I was aided a good deal by a fantastic article on K6 implementation: [Load Test your NodeJS app using K6](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/load-test-your-nodejs-app-using-k6-f7b2bd8fa5cf)

I have been reading up on Postgres indexing over the past couple days but have not implemented yet. [PostgreSQL Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/indexes-intro.html) Thus, Styles continues to be the most inefficient API, as highlighted by stress testing only successfully returning 33% of the requests.
