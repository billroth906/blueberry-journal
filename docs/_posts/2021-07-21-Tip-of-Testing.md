### Tip of the Iceburg

Testing implemented on my API is mainly integration at this point, revealing whether the database is returning expected data with expected fields through the server. But I feel as though I have only touched the tip of the iceburg as far as the capabilities of testing go. I am a little bit disappointed that this Products API does not implement any POST requests. That would provide a bit more opportunity to get into the practice of mocking some tests. At this point I could very much use that exposure. Whether the tests work or not, well, we'll soon see... after the API is properly functioning.
